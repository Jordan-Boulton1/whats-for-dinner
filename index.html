    <h1>What's for Dinner?</h1>
    <p>
      If you've ever had the conversation with a family member about what you want to plan for dinner and you get the
      reply "I don't know, you pick", we know the struggle.
      <br>
      That's why we've got you covered,
      just enter some of the ingredients in your cupboard or fridge, or take your pick with our randomizer and featured
      recipes.
