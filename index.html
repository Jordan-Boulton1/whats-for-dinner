  <p>
    If you've ever had the conversation with a family member about what you want to plan for dinner, and you get the
    reply "I don't know, you pick", we know your pain. That's why we've got you covered.
    Just Enter some of the ingredients in your cupboard or fridge, or take your pick with our randomizer and featured recipes.
