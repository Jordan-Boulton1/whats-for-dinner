# [WHATS FOR DINNER](https://jordan-boulton1.github.io/whats-for-dinner)

What's for Dinner is a website that is designed to take the hassel out of wondering what you are going to have for dinner, and make planning that much easier. Users of the website will be able to use the search input to search ingredients or recipes which they wish to make. Through an API, 8 different recipe cards will be generatewd that will provide the user with the required ingredients and instructions on how to make that specific recipe.

## UX

When creating the website I wanted a very simple yet clean design, where the page didn't feel too cluttered.

### Colour Scheme

The colours chosen on my website were taken as inspiration from various different food websites which feature a nice almond colour with a dark red to compliment.

- `#ffffff` used for primary text.
- `#000000` used for secondary text.
- `#EAE0D5` used for the background of the dynamically loaded cards.
- `#9D0208` used for secondary highlights such as the border of the recipe cards and their buttons.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-eae0d5-9d0208-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Mada](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mada?query=mada) was used for the primary title.

- [Mukta Vaani](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta+Vaani?query=Mukta) was used for the recipe card title and cuisine type.

- [Overpass](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass?query=Overpass) was used for all paragraphs and list ingredients on the page.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used on the dynamically loaded recipe cards to display how many people the recipes will feed, the time to make the recipe and how many calories are in the recipe.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
